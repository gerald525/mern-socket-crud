# mern-crud

A CRUD starter kit using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Semantic UI React was used for the UI.

Make sure MongoDB service is running.

<br>

For the **back-end**, install the dependencies once.
```
npm install
```
Run the server.
```
npm start
``` 

<br>

For the **front-end**, go to *react-src* folder via the terminal.

```
cd react-src
```

Install the node packages required by React once.
```
npm install
```

Run the development server for React.
```
npm start
```

To make a production build, simply run on *react-src* folder.
```
npm run build
```

It will create a folder named *public* on the root directory. This is where the production-ready front-end of the web application will reside.

## Features You Can Manually Add

* Front-end validation. Pure back-end validation is expensive.
* Real-time broadcast using socket.io
